# Showcase
The showcase of everything I have done up till today as part of my studies at CTU FIT in Prague.

This repostitory is split into files by language, so far that includes bash (including sed and awk), perl, C and C++.
Everything in the C folder was made during my first semester, the rest comes from the second semester.
